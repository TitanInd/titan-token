TITAN VISION


Bitcoin and other decentralized and trustless proof of work blockchains find their strength in numbers. Numbers literally in both the cryptography and the diverse user base. Peer-to-peer electronic cash is what the vision was, a currency by the people with no centralized authority or backers. Unfortunately we see a common trend in the POW world, centralization of hashrate. Not just from the conglomerate of large pools but also the rise of enterprise mining.

One hash equals one vote used to be the mantra, but what happens when a handful of larger players dominate the vote? We need to provide means for greater access to hashrate and thereby distributing the votes to a greater user base and in effect keeping POW networks decentralized. We call this effort the decentralization of control of hashrate.

To accomplish this we have designed a way to control hashrate in a decentralized fashion through the use of smart contract driven proxy routers.
